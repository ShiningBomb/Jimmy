# Jimmy
Easy to use AI optimization helper library for enterprise applications

With Jimmy you can have text or even complex formulas as parameter, all using your existing optimization algorithm for numeric parameter and functions that you already have. Even you can use non-discerete algorithm for optimizing discrete parameters all at ease. 

### Main features ###
* Easily use candidate values and formulas instead of min, max, and resolution for each parameter because no one actually use that!
* Provide interface for firing progress and results to the UI, so user don't have to wait at blank screen.
* Provide interface for when optimization cancels in the UI, so it can terminate soon.
* Prevent duplicate evaluation so you have one less thing to think about.
